## Files in the Repository
- **Fast Fashion Supply Chain Slidedeck.pdf**: This slide deck provides an overview of the project, including the problem statement, our objectives, and the methodology used.
- **Fast Fashion Supply Chain Models.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook that contains Python code for the optimization models used in our analysis.
- **Fast Fashion Supply Chain Models Solver.xlsx**: An Excel spreadsheet with solver models for production and transshipment problems.
- **Fast Fashion Supply Chain Documentation.pdf**: Comprehensive documentation detailing the problem statements, models, analyses, and findings.

## Project Structure
- **Model 1: Production Analysis**
  - Focuses on minimizing production costs by optimizing the allocation of manufacturing across different factories.
- **Model 2: Transshipment Analysis**
  - Aims to minimize transportation costs by optimizing the allocation of shipments from factories to warehouses.

## Technologies Used
- Python: For advanced data manipulation and solving complex optimization problems.
- Excel: To model initial optimization scenarios and understand constraints.

## Key Insights
- Identification of bottleneck factories and warehouses that, if expanded, could significantly reduce costs.
- Recommendations for reallocating underutilized capacities and optimizing transshipment routes.

## Challenges
- Handling the complex nature of fast fashion supply chains with a large number of decision variables.
- Managing data integration and preprocessing to ensure consistent and actionable results.
